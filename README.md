# Axle

Axle is a WIP 3D game engine written in C++ from scratch using OpenGL.

This project is **far** from being complete enough to be used for anything so far.

Graphical assets used in the project are from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/).

## TODOS

- Add a copy constructor to the Texture class
